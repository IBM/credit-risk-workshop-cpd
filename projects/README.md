# CreditRiskProject.zip instructions

The CreditRiskProject.zip contains:

* Seven notebooks:
  * machinelearning-creditrisk-batchscoring-<ID>.ipynb
  * machinelearning-creditrisk-sparkmlmodel-<ID>.ipynb
  * openscale-full-configuration-<ID>.ipynb
  * openscale-fairness-explainability-<ID>.ipynb
  * openscale-quality-feedback-<ID>.ipynb
  * openscale-initial-setup-<ID>.ipynb
  * openscale-drift-config-<ID>.ipynb

* Four CSV files:

  * german_credit_data.csv
  * German-Credit-Risk-SmallBatchSet.csv
  * german_credit_data_noid.csv
  * german_credit_data_plus_personal.csv

Anytime they are changed in the repo, we need to upload it to a project. Then we need to export the project, and save that zip. Then update the `CreditRiskProject.zip` in this repo.
If they files are changed in the Project on CPD, they need to be exported separately and put into the proper directory in the repository. Then merge the changes into the repo.

`CreditRiskProject.zip` is in `projects/`
`*.ipynb` notebooks are in `notebooks/`
`*.csv` files are in `data/`
