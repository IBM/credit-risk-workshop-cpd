You need to provide platform `api_key` and instance `location`.\n\nYou should have created an API Key during the pre-work section which you can use. If you don't have an API Key, you can follow these instructions to create another one.\n\n\nYou can use [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html) to retrieve platform API Key and instance location.\n\nAPI Key can be generated in the following way:\n```\nibmcloud login\nibmcloud iam api-key-create API_KEY_NAME\n```\n\nIn result, get the value of `api_key` from the output.\n\n\nLocation of your WML instance can be retrieved in the following way:\n```\nibmcloud login --apikey API_KEY -a https://cloud.ibm.com\nibmcloud resource service-instance WML_INSTANCE_NAME\n```\n\nIn result, get the value of `location` from the output.\n\n**Tip**: Your `Cloud API key` can be generated by going to the [**Users** section of the Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam#/users). From that page, click your name, scroll down to the **API Keys** section, and click **Create an IBM Cloud API key**. Give your key a name and click **Create**, then copy the created key and paste it below.\n\nYou can also get service specific apikey by going to the [**Service IDs** section of the Cloud Console](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/serviceids).
