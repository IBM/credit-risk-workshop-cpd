# Machine Learning Model Deployment and Scoring

In this module, we will learn how to deploy our Machine Learning models. By doing so, we make them available for use in production such that applications and business processes can derive insights from them. There are several types of deployments available ([depending on the model framework used](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/wsj/analyze-data/pm_service_supported_frameworks.html)), of which we will explore:

* Online Deployments - Allows you to run the model on data in real-time, as data is received by a web service.
* Batch Deployments - Allows you to run the model against data as a batch process.

This module is broken up into several sections that explore the different model deployment options as well as the different ways to invoke or consume them. The first section of this lab will build an online deployment and test the model endpoint using both the built in testing tool as well as external testing tools. The remaining sections are optional, they build and test the batch deployment, followed by using the model from a python application.

1. [Online Deployment for a Model](#online-model-deployment)
   * Create Online model deployment
   * Test the deployed model web UI
   * (Optional) Test model using cURL

2. [(Optional) Batch Deployment for a Model](#optional-batch-model-deployment)
   * Create Batch Deployment
   * Create and Schedule a Job

3. [(Optional) Integrate Model to an External Application](#optional-integrate-model-to-python-flask-application)

> **Note:** The lab instructions below assume you have completed the pre-work section already, if not, be sure to complete the pre-work first to create a project and a deployment space.

## Online Model Deployment

After a model has been created, saved and promoted to our deployment space, we can procceed to dpeloying the model. For this section, we will be creating an online deployment. This type of deployment will make an instance of the model available to make predictions in real time via an API. Although we will use the Cloud Pak for Data UI to deploy the model, the same can be done programmatically.

* Navigate to the left-hand (â˜°) hamburger menu and choose `Analyze` -> `Analytics deployments`:

![Analytics Analyze deployments](../.gitbook/assets/images/navigation/menu-analytics-deployments.png)

* Choose the deployment space you setup previously by clicking on the name of your space.

* From your deployment space overview, in the table, click on the model name that you previousely promoted. Next, you can click on the `Create Deployment`. 

> Note: There may be more than one model listed in them 'Models' section. This can happen if you have run the Jupyter notebook more than once or if you have run through both the Jupyter notebook and AutoAI modules to create models. Although you could select any of the models you see listed in the page, the recommendation is to start with whicever model is available that is using a `spark-mllib_2.3` runtime (this is denoted in the `Software Specification` column).
![Actions Deploy model](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-spark-model-button.png)

* On the `Create a deployment` screen, choose `Online` for the `Deployment Type`, give the Deployment a name and optionally a description and click the `Create` button.

![Online Deployment Create](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-online-deployment.png)

* The Deployment will show as `In progress` and then switch to `Deployed` when done.

![Status Deployed](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-status-deployed.png)

### Test Online Model Deployment

Cloud Pak for Data offers tools to quickly test out Watson Machine Learning models. We begin with the built-in tooling.

* From the Model deployment page, once the deployment status shows as `Deployed`, click on the name of your deployment. The deployment `API reference` tab shows how to use the model using `cURL`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `Python`, and `Scala`.

* To get to the built-in test tool, click on the `Test` tab and then click on the `Provide input data as JSON` icon.

![Test deployment with JSON](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-model-test-page.png)

* Copy and paste the following data objects into the `Body` panel 

> (**Note:** Make sure the input below is the only content in the field. Do not append it to the default content `{ "input_data": [] }` that may already be in the field. Instead, remove the exsiting content and replace it with the following data.).

```json
{
  "input_data": [
    {
      "fields": [ "CheckingStatus", "LoanDuration", "CreditHistory", "LoanPurpose", "LoanAmount", "ExistingSavings", "EmploymentDuration", "InstallmentPercent", "Sex", "OthersOnLoan", "CurrentResidenceDuration", "OwnsProperty", "Age", "InstallmentPlans", "Housing", "ExistingCreditsCount", "Job", "Dependents", "Telephone", "ForeignWorker"],
      "values": [
        [ "no_checking", 13, "credits_paid_to_date", "car_new", 1343, "100_to_500", "1_to_4", 2, "female", "none", 3, "savings_insurance", 46, "none", "own", 2, "skilled", 1, "none", "yes"]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* Click the `Predict` button. The model will be called with the input data and the results will display in the `Result` window. Scroll down to the bottom of the result to see the prediction (i.e "Risk" or "No Risk"):

![Testing the deployed model](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-test-model-prediction.png)

> **Note:** For some deployed models (for example AutoAI based models), you can provide the request payload using a generated form by clicking on the `Provide input using form` icon and providing values for the input fields of the form. If the form is not available for the model you deployed, the icon will not be present or will remain grayed out.
> ![Input to the fields](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-test-input-form.png)

### (Optional) Test Online Model Deployment using cURL

Now that the model is deployed, we can also test it from external applications. One way to invoke the model API is using the cURL command.

> **Note for WINDOWS users:** This section uses commands available in unix-based systems (MacOS, Linux, ...). Windows users can use [IBM Cloud Shell](https://cloud.ibm.com/shell) or if you want to run the commands locally, it is recommended to [download gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or enable [Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) if you use Windows 10. If neither option works for you, you will need to adapt the commands for your system to follow this section (for instance, you need to change `export` commands to `set` commands, and find an alternative for `cURL`)

* First step is to install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/learn/cli). You can follow the instructions in the link to do so. 
  
* In order to get access token you need to have `API Key`, that you can get from your IBM cloud account. You can create one by running following command. Remember to save your API Key as they can't be retrieved after they are created.

```bash
ibmcloud iam api-key-create <key name>
```
![Model Deployment Endpoint](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/api-key.png)

* Next, in a terminal window, run the following command to get a token to access the API. Replace `<API Key>` with the api key that you got from running above command.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Accept: application/json' --data-urlencode 'grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey' --data-urlencode 'apikey=<API Key>'
```

* A json string will be returned with a value for `accessToken` that will look *similar* to this:

```json
{"access_token":"AAAAAAAfakeACCESSTOKENNNNNNN","refresh_token":"BBBBBBBBBBBFAKEREFRESHTOKENNNNNNNNNNNNN","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3600,"expiration":1601317201,"scope":"ibm openid"}
```

* You will save the access token right after the `access_token` in a temporary environment variable in your terminal. Copy the access token value (without the quotes) in the terminal and then use the following export command to save the "accessToken" to a variable called `WML_AUTH_TOKEN`.

```bash
export WML_AUTH_TOKEN=<value-of-access-token>
```



* Back on the model deployment page, gather the `URL` to invoke the deployed model from the *API reference* by copying the `Endpoint`.

![Model Deployment Endpoint](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-model-endpoint.png)

* Now save that endpoint to a variable named `URL` in your terminal by exporting it. URL also requires a version query parameter.

```bash
export WML_URL=<value-of-endpoint>
```

Example of an URL:

```bash
export WML_URL="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4/deployments/<DEPLOYMENT_ID>/predictions?version=2020-09-01"
```

* Now run this curl command from the terminal to invoke the model with the same payload we used previousy:

```bash
curl -k -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header "Authorization: Bearer  $WML_AUTH_TOKEN" -d '{"input_data": [{"fields": [ "CheckingStatus", "LoanDuration", "CreditHistory", "LoanPurpose", "LoanAmount", "ExistingSavings", "EmploymentDuration", "InstallmentPercent", "Sex", "OthersOnLoan", "CurrentResidenceDuration", "OwnsProperty", "Age", "InstallmentPlans", "Housing", "ExistingCreditsCount", "Job", "Dependents", "Telephone", "ForeignWorker"],"values": [[ "no_checking", 13, "credits_paid_to_date", "car_new", 1343, "100_to_500", "1_to_4", 2, "female", "none", 3, "savings_insurance", 46, "none", "own", 2, "skilled", 1, "none", "yes"]]}]}' $WML_URL
```

* A json string will be returned with the response, including a  prediction from the model (i.e a "Risk" or "No Risk" at the end indicating the prediction of this loan representing risk).

## (Optional) Batch Model Deployment

Another approach to expose the model to be consumed by other users/applications is to create a batch deployment. This type of deployment will make an instance of the model available to make predictions against data assets or groups of records. The model prediction requests are scheduled as jobs, which are executed asynchronously. For the lab, we will break this into two steps: 
1. Creating the batch deployment
2. Creating and scheduling the batch job

Lets start by creating the deployment:

* Navigate to the left-hand (â˜°) hamburger menu and choose `Deployment Spaces` -> `View all spaces`:

![Analytics Analyze deployments](../.gitbook/assets/images/navigation/menu-analytics-deployments.png)

* Choose the deployment space you created previously by clicking on the name of the space.

* From your deployment space overview, in the table, find the model name for the model you previously built and now want to create a deployment against. Use your mouse to hover over the right side of that table row and click the `Deploy` rocket icon (the icons are not visible by default until you hover over them).

> Note: There may be more than one model listed in them 'Models' section. This can happen if you have run the Jupyter notebook more than once or if you have run through both the Jupyter notebook and AutoAI modules to create models. Although you could select any of the models you see listed in the page, the recommendation is to start with whicever model is available that is using a `spark-mllib_2.3` runtime.

![Actions Deploy model](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-spark-model.png)

* On the 'Create a deployment' screen: choose `Batch` for the *Deployment Type*, give the deployment a name and optional description. From the 'Hardware definition' drop down, select the smallest option (`1 standard CPU, 4GB RAM` in this case though for large or frequent batch jobs, you might choose to scale the hardware up). Click the *`Create`* button.

![Batch Deployment Create](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-batch-deployment.png)

* Once the status shows as *Deployed* you will be able to start submitting jobs to the deployment.

![Status Deployed](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy-batch_dep_status.png)

### Create and Schedule a Job

Next we can schedule a job to run against our batch deployment. We could create a job, with specific input data (or data asset) and schedule, either programmatically or through the UI. For this lab, we are going to do this programmatically using the Python client SDK. For this part of the exercise we're going to use a Jupyter notebook to create and submit a batch job to our model deployment.

>*Note: The batch job input is impacted by the machine learning framework used to build the model. Currently, SparkML based model batch jobs require inline payload to be used. For other frameworks, we can use data assets (i.e CSV files) as the input payload.*

#### Run the Batch Notebook

The Jupyter notebook is already included as an asset in the project you imported earlier.

* Go the (â˜°) navigation menu and click on the `Projects` link and then click on your analytics project.

![(â˜°) Menu -> Projects](../.gitbook/assets/images/navigation/menu-projects.png)

* From the project overview page, click on the `Assets` tab to open the assets page where your project assets are stored and organized.

* Scroll down to the `Notebooks` section of the page and click on the pencil icon at the right of the `machinelearning-creditrisk-batchscoring` notebook.

![Notebook Open](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/deploy_batch_open_nb.png)

* When the Jupyter notebook is loaded and the kernel is ready, we will be ready to start executing it in the next section.

##### Notebook sections

With the notebook open, spend a minute looking through the sections of the notebook to get an overview. A notebook is composed of text (markdown or heading) cells and code cells. The markdown cells provide comments on what the code is designed to do. You will run cells individually by highlighting each cell, then either click the `Run` button at the top of the notebook or hitting the keyboard short cut to run the cell (Shift + Enter but can vary based on platform). While the cell is running, an asterisk (`[*]`) will show up to the left of the cell. When that cell has finished executing a sequential number will show up (i.e. `[17]`).

> **Note:** Please note that some of the comments in the notebook are directions for you to modify specific sections of the code. These are writted in **red**. Perform any changes neccessary, as indicated in the cells, before executing them.



> **Important**: *Make sure that you stop the kernel of your notebook(s) when you are done, in order to conserve resources! You can do this by going to the Asset page of the project, selecting the three vertical dots under the Action column for the notebook you have been running and selecting to `Stop Kernel` from the Actions menu. If you see a lock icon on the notebook, click it to unlock the notebook before you click the Actions so you can see the stop kernel option.*
> ![Stop kernel](../.gitbook/assets/images/ml/stop-notebook-kernel.png)

## (Optional) Integrate Model to Python Flask Application

You can also access the online model deployment directly through the REST API. This allows you to use your model for inference in any of your apps. For this workshop we'll be using a Python Flask application to collect information, score it against the model, and show the results.

> **IMPORTANT: This SAMPLE application only runs on python 3.6 and above, so the instructions here are for python 3.6+ only. You will need to have Python 3.6 or later already installed on your machine**
> *Note: The instructions below assume you have completed the pre-work module and thus have the Git repository already on your machine (cloned or downloaded).*

### Install Dependencies

The general recommendation for Python development is to use a virtual environment ([`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)). To install and initialize a virtual environment, use the `venv` module on Python 3:

* Initialize a virtual environment with [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Run the following commands in a terminal (or command prompt):

  ```bash
  # Create the virtual environment using Python.
  # Note, it may be named python3 on your system.
  python -m venv venv       # Python 3.X

  # Source the virtual environment. Use one of the two commands depending on your OS.
  source venv/bin/activate  # Mac or Linux
  ./venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows PowerShell
  ```

  > **TIP** To terminate the virtual environment use the `deactivate` command.

* To install the Python requirements, from a terminal (or command prompt) navigate to where you cloned/downloaded the Git repository. Run the following commands:

  ```bash
  cd flaskapp
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Update Environment Variables

It's best practice to store configurable information as environment variables, instead of hard-coding any important information. To reference our model and supply an API key, we'll pass these values in via a file that is read, the key-value pairs in this files are stored as environment variables.

* Copy the `env.sample` file to `.env`.

  ```bash
  cp env.sample .env
  ```

* Edit `.env` to and fill in the `MODEL_URL` as well as the `AUTH_URL`, `AUTH_USERNAME`, and `AUTH_PASSWORD`.

  * `MODEL_URL` is your web service URL for scoring which you got from the section above
  * `AUTH_URL` is the preauth url of your CloudPak4Data and will look like this: `https://<cluster_url>/v1/preauth/validateAuth`
  * `AUTH_USERNAME` is your username with which you login to the CloudPak4Data environment
  * `AUTH_PASSWORD` is your password with which you login to the CloudPak4Data environment

  >Note: Alternatively, you can fill in the `AUTH_TOKEN` instead of `AUTH_URL`, `AUTH_USERNAME`, and `AUTH_PASSWORD`. You will have generated this token in the section above. However, since tokens expire after a few hours and you would need to restart your app to update the token, this option is not suggested. Instead, if you use the username/password option, the app can generate a new token every time for you so it will always have a non-expired ones.

* Here's an example of a completed lines of the .env file.

  ```bash
  # Required: Provide your web service URL for scoring.
  # E.g., MODEL_URL=https://<cluster_url>/v4/deployments/<deployment_space_guid>/predictions
  MODEL_URL=https://cp4d.cp4dworkshops.com/v4/deployments/5f939979-14c2-4538-a2af-a970aeb59abd/predictions

  # Required: Please fill in EITHER section A OR B below:

  # #### A: Authentication using username and password
  #   Fill in the authntication url, your CloudPak4Data username, and CloudPak4Data password.
  #   Example:
  #     AUTH_URL=<cluster_url>/v1/preauth/validateAuth
  #     AUTH_USERNAME=my_username
  #     AUTH_PASSWORD=super_complex_password
  AUTH_URL=https://cp4d.cp4dworkshops.com/v1/preauth/validateAuth
  AUTH_USERNAME=username_001
  AUTH_PASSWORD=my_secure_password_!
  ```

### Start Application

* Start the flask server by running the following command:

  ```bash
  python creditriskapp.py
  ```

* Use your browser to go to [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000) and try it out.

  > **TIP**: Use `ctrl`+`c` to stop the Flask server when you are done.

#### Test the application

* Either use the default values pre-filled in the input form, or modify the value and then click the `Submit` button. The python application will invoke the predictive model and a risk prediction & probability is returned:

![Get the risk percentage as a result](../.gitbook/assets/images/deployment/flaskapp-output.png)
