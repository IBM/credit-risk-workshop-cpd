## Configuring the Drift Monitor manually using the GUI tool

The submodule contains the following steps:

1. [Open the notebook](#1-open-the-notebook)
1. [Update credentials](#2-update-credentials)
1. [Run the notebook](#3-run-the-notebook)
1. [Look at Drift in the Dashboard](#4-look-at-drift-in-the-dashboard)

## 1. Open the notebook

If you [Created the Project](https://ibm-developer.gitbook.io/cloudpakfordata-credit-risk-workshop/getting-started/pre-work#create-a-new-project) using the [CreditRiskProject.zip](https://github.ibm.com/IBMDeveloper/cp4d-workshop-credit-risk/blob/master/projects/CreditRiskProject.zip) file, the `openscale-drift-config` notebook will be present in that project, under the `Assets` tab:

![Project from zip assets tab](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-drift-notebook.png)

You may now skip to the next step [Update credentials](#2-update-credentials)

## Import the notebook (If you are not using the Project Import pre-work steps)

> NOTE: You should probably not need this step, and should only perform it if instructed to.

If, for some reason, you are not using the [Created the Project](https://ibm-developer.gitbook.io/cloudpakfordata-credit-risk-workshop/getting-started/pre-work#create-a-new-project) step in the Pre-work to import [CreditRiskProject.zip](https://github.ibm.com/IBMDeveloper/cp4d-workshop-credit-risk/blob/master/projects/CreditRiskProject.zip), then you will need to import the notebook file by itself. Use the following steps for that.

At the project overview click the *New Asset* button, and choose *Add notebook*.

![Add a new asset](../.gitbook/assets/images/wml/wml-add-asset.png)

On the next panel select the *From URL* tab, give your notebook a name, provide the following URL, and choose the Python 3.6 environment:

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd/master/notebooks/openscale-drift-config.ipynb
```

> The notebook is hosted in the same repo as [the workshop](https://github.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd)
>
> * **Notebook**: [openscale-drift-config.ipynb](../../notebooks/openscale-drift-config.ipynb)
> * **Notebook with output**: [openscale-drift-config-with-output.ipynb](../../notebooks/with-output/openscale-drift-config-with-output.ipynb)

![Add notebook name and URL](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-url-drift.png)

When the Jupyter notebook is loaded and the kernel is ready then we can start executing cells.

### 2. Update credentials

#### WOS_CREDENTIALS

* In the notebook section *2.0*  you will add your Cloud Pak for Data platform credentials for the *WOS_CREDENTIALS*.

* For the `url` field, change `https://w.x.y.z` to use the URL your Cloud Pak for Data cluster, i.e something like: `"url": "https://zen-cpd-zen.omid-cp4d-v5-2bef1f4b4097001da9502000c44fc2b2-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud"`.
* For the `username`, use your Cloud Pak for Data login username.
* For the `password`, user your Cloud Pak for Data login password.

### 3. Run the notebook

> **Important**: *Make sure that you stop the kernel of your notebook(s) when you are done, in order to prevent leaking of memory resources!*

![Stop kernel](../.gitbook/assets/images/wml/JupyterStopKernel.png)

Spend an minute looking through the sections of the notebook to get an overview. You will run cells individually by highlighting each cell, then either click the `Run` button at the top of the notebook. While the cell is running, an asterisk (`[*]`) will show up to the left of the cell. When that cell has finished executing a sequential number will show up (i.e. `[17]`).


### 4. Look at Drift in the Dashboard

* In the same browser \(but a separate tab\), open the `Services` tab by clicking the icon in the upper right. Click on the `OpenScale` tile under the `AI` category, and in the next window, click `Open`:

![Deploy OpenScale](../.gitbook/assets/images/aios/aios-deploy-service.png)

* When the dashboard loads, _**Click**_ on the _**'Model Monitors'**_  tab and you will see the deployment you configured in the jupyter notebook when you ran it in a previous section:

![Explore OpenScale Model monitors](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-explore-model-monitors.png)

Do not worry if the name you see does not match exactly with the screenshot. The deployment name you see will correspond to the variable used in the Jupyter notebook

* Now we can click on the `Drift` -> `Drop in Accuracy` tab and see the graph of transactions:

![Drift Drop in accuracy](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-drift-drop.png)

* Click on a time slice in the graph and a window will show the number of transactions responsible "for drop in accuracy" and "for drop in data consistency":

![Drift transactions](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-drift-drops-consistency.png)

* You can choose either or both to get details about "Transactions responsible for drop in accuracy and data consistency":

![Transactions responsible for drop in accuracy and data consistency](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-drift-details.png)

* Drilling deeper will bring up the individual transactions:

![Drift list of transactions](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-drift-transactions-responsible.png)

* And as we've seen before, we can choose a transaction to get the details:

### Recap

We've seen how to save the Machine Learning model configuration, and then proceed to configure Drift monitoring using the OpenScale GUI. This method can be used to configure other monitors, as a complement to the method of using the APIs in a Jupyter notebook. Next, we'll add some historical data to emulate what would happen for a Machine learning model that is deployed in production, monitored with OpenScale, and continually receiving scoring requests.
