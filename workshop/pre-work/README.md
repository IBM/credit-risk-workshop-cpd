## 1. Download or Clone the Repository
<!-- TODO: ADD PROJECT TO GALLERY -->
Various parts of this workshop will require the attendee to upload files or run scripts that we've stored in the repository. To download the repository and its assets, you have two options. Option 1, if you have the [`git`](https://git-scm.com) command line interface on your laptop, you can clone the repository directly. Option 2, if you don't have git you can access the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd) page to download the zip file.

* **[Option 1]** If you have the git CLI, run the following commands from a terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd.git
   cd credit-risk-workshop-cpd
   ```

* **[Option 2]** To download the repository as a zip file, go to the [GitHub repo for this workshop](https://github.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd) and download the archived version of the workshop and extract it on your laptop.

![download workshop zip](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/github-zip-download.png)

> **Note: If you used Option 2, make sure you extract or unzip the zip file after it's downloaded. This is not needed if you followed Option 1**

## 2. Create IBM Cloud account and log into IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service

* Launch a browser and navigate to [IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/login?context=cpdaas).

* You can log into your IBM Cloud account using your IBMid. If you don't have one, you can click on `Sign up and try for free` to create a free IBM Cloud account.

## 3. Create a Project and Deployment Space

### Create a New Project
<!-- TODO: If project is cloned form the Gallery, this is already done. -->

In Cloud Pak for Data, we use the concept of a project to collect / organize the resources used to achieve a particular goal (resources to build a solution to a problem). Your project resources can include data, collaborators, and analytic assets like notebooks and models, etc.

* Go the (☰) navigation menu, expand *Projects* and click on the *View all projects* link.

![(☰) Menu -> Projects](../.gitbook/assets/images/navigation/menu-projects.png)

* Click on the `New +` button on the top.

![Start a new project](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/new-project.png)

* We are going to create a project from an existing file (which contains the assets we will use throughout this workshop), as opposed to creating an empty project. Select the _*Create a project from a sample or file*_ option.

![Create project from file](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/new-project-from-file.png)

* Click on the **browse** link and in the file browser popup, navigate to where you cloned or downloaded this repository in the previous section. Then select the `CreditRiskProject.zip` file in the `projects/` folder there.

![Browse for project files](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/browse-project-zip.png)

* Give the project a name. You also need to provide an object storage instance for this project. If you haven't already created a Cloud Object Storage instance in your IBM Cloud account, you can create one now by clicking `Add`.

![Project name](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/project-import-name.png)

* A new tab opens up, where you can create the Cloud Object Service. By default, a `Lite` (Free) plan will be selected. Scroll down and update the name of your Cloud Object Storage service if you wish, and click `Create`.

![Create COS instance](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/create-cos-instance.png)

* The browser tab will automatically close when the Cloud Object Storage instance has been created. Back on IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, click `Refresh`.

![Refresh COS](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/refresh-cos.png)

* The newly created Cloud Object Storage instance will now be displayed under "Storage". Click `Create` to finish creating the project.

![Create project](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/create-project.png)

* You can see a progress bar that says your project is being created. Once the project is succesfully created, on the pop up window click on the `View new project` button.

![Import project success](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/project-import-success.png)

* Clicking on the *Assets* tab will show all the assets that were imported into the project when it was created.

<!-- TODO: Once the zip file is finalized, update the screenshot. -->
![Project assets](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/project-assets.png)

<!-- TODO later: Add this back once DV is rolled out
### Add a connection to the project

Some of the data assets required for this workshop are stored in an external DB2 Warehouse instance on IBM Cloud. The next step is to add the DB2 Warehouse instance as a connection to the project, so that these data assets can be accessed.

* Click on `Add to project +` and select `Connection`.

![Add connection to project](../.gitbook/assets/images/connections/conn-new-connection.png)

* Click on `Db2 Warehouse`.

![Add DB2WH connection](../.gitbook/assets/images/connections/conn-new-connection-db2-warehouse.png)

* Provide the connection details for the Db2 Warehouse connection and click `Create`.

> **Note**: The Db2 Warehouse connection details will be provided by the instructor.

![Add connection to project](../.gitbook/assets/images/connections/conn-details.png)

* Once the connection has been successfully added to the project, you can see it listed under *Data assets* on your project's *Assets* tab.

![Add connection to project](../.gitbook/assets/images/connections/conn-add-success.png) -->

### Associate a Watson Machine Learning Service instance to the project

You will need to associate a Watson Machine Learning service instance to your project in order to run Machine Learning experiments.

* Go to the *Settings* tab of your project and look for the *Associated services* section. Click on `Add service` and in the menu that opens up, click on `Watson`.

![Add Watson service](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/add-watson-service.png)

* Click the checkbox next to the Watson Machine Learning service instance that was created for you when you signed up for Cloud Pak for Data as a Service. Click `Associate service`.

> **Note:** If you have multiple WatsonMachineLearning services, make sure you select the one that is in the same regions as is your Cloud Pak for Data as a service. 

> **Note:** Also make sure that the Name of the instance matches the name of the WatsonMachineLearning that you added in the earlier steps

![Choose WML instance](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/choose-wml-instance.png)

* You will  see a notification that the WatsonMachineLearning service was successfully associated with your project. Click on the `X` in the right top corner to close the pop up modal and go back to your project.

![WML Service added successfully](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/wml-service-added-successfully.png)

### Create a Deployment Space

Cloud Pak for Data uses the concept of `Deployment Spaces` to configure and manage the deployment of a set of related deployable assets. These assets can be data files, machine learning models, etc. For this workshop, we need to create one.

* Go the (☰) navigation menu, expand `Deployment spaces` and then select `View all spaces`.

![(☰) Menu -> Deployment spaces](../.gitbook/assets/images/navigation/menu-analytics-deployments.png)

* Click on the `New deployment space` button.

![Add New deployment space](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/new-deployment-space.png)

* We will create an empty deployment space, so click on the `Create an empty space` option.

![Create empty deployment space](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/new-deployment-space-empty.png)

* Give your deployment space a unique name and optional description. Provide the Cloud Object Storage instance that you had created when you were creating the project and select the Machine Learning Service instance associated with your IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service instance, then click the `Create` button.

![Deployment space name](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/deployment-space-name.png)

* Once the deployment space is created, you can click on `View new space`. 

![View deployment space](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/view-deployment-space.png)

## 4. Get the IBM Cloud platform API key and Watson Machine Learning service instance location

In some parts of this workshop, you will be executing Jupyter notebooks which use the Watson Machine Learning API to perform operations on your Watson Machine Learning instance. For the Jupyter notebooks to gain access to your Watson Machine Learning instance, you will need to provide them with the API key for your IBM Cloud account as well as the location of the WML service instance.

### Get the IBM Cloud platform API key

Use one of the following methods to retrieve the IBM Cloud Platform API key:

1. [Using the IBM Cloud CLI](#1-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli)
1. [Using the IBM Cloud console](#2-using-the-ibm-cloud-console)

#### 1. Using the IBM Cloud CLI

* Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html) using the instructions in the link.

* Once the IBM Cloud CLI is installed, run the following command in your terminal to log into your IBM Cloud account. Running this command will prompt you to enter your email address and password.

```bash
ibmcloud login
```

* Once you have successfully logged in, generate an API key using the following command. Replace API_KEY_NAME with a unique name.

```bash
ibmcloud iam api-key-create API_KEY_NAME
```

* Get the value of `API Key` from the result of the command. This is the *api_key* value that you will need to provide in your Jupyter notebooks for accessing the Watson Machine Learning service instance.

#### 2. Using the IBM Cloud console

Alternatively, you can use the IBM Cloud Console to generate the IBM Cloud API key.

* Go to the [API keys section of the Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

* Select `My IBM Cloud API keys` in the *View* dropdown and then click `Create an IBM Cloud API key +`. 

![Create IBM Cloud API Key](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/create-ibm-cloud-api-key.png)

* Give your API key a unique name and click `Create`. You should see a message that says `API key successfully created`. Click `Copy` to copy the generated API key. 

![Copy API key](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/copy-api-key.png)

This is the `api_key` value that you will need to provide in your Jupyter notebooks for accessing the Watson Machine Learning service instance.

### Get the Watson Machine Learning service instance location

<!-- TODO: In case we can only use Frankfurt and Dallas, remove the rest. -->
**Option 1:**
You can select the Watson Machine Learning location code from the table below if you are sure where you've deployed your instance. 

| Region       |   Region Codes | 
|--------------|------------| 
| Dallas       | us-south   | 
| Tokyo        | jp-tok     | 


**Option 2:** Alternatively, if you prefer to use the CLI, you can use the API key to obtain the location of the Watson Machine Learning Service instance associated with your IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service instance.

* Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html) using the instructions in the link.

* Run the following command in a terminal to log into IBM Cloud using the API Key you had generated earlier. Remember to update `API_KEY` with your api key.

```bash
ibmcloud login --apikey API_KEY -a https://cloud.ibm.com
```

* Run the following command to retrieve information about the Watson Machine Learning service instance. Remember to update `WML_INSTANCE_NAME` with the name of the Watson Machine Learning instance associated with your IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service instance.

```bash
ibmcloud resource service-instance WML_INSTANCE_NAME
```

* Get the value of `Location` from this result. This is the *location* value that you will need to provide in your Jupyter notebooks for accessing the Watson Machine Learning service instance.




## Conclusion

We have now completed creating an IBM Cloud account, a Cloud Pak for Data as a Service instance, and the project and deployment space that we will use in the rest of this workshop. We have also obtained the IBM Cloud API key and the Watson Machine Learning service instance location region code that we will use in the Jupyter notebooks section.
