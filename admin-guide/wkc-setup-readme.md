# Watson Knowledge Catalog Enterprise Example

These instructions will allow an Admin to setup Watson Knowledge Catalog with an example that shows how an large enterprise would use WKC in various ways.

> NOTE: Do not run discovery through Data Curation > Data Discovery on the entire database. We only need to discover three schemas; MORTGAGE, INSURANCE and CUSTOMER. We wil do this as the very last steps in the run book.
If we discover everything it will flood the Default synch catalog with unwanted and unnecessary tables with OpenScale and all System objects. We will then have to go in and delete everything through the Metadata import facility (known as IMAM) and that could mess up IGC if we don’t do it carefully.

## Create the Organize Data

This will all be done in a Db2 Warehouse on IBM Cloud. Other versions of DB2 could be used, i.e. DB2 Server Edition on the CPD cluster.

### Create the Schemas and Tables

Run the [OrganizeExperience.sql](scripts/OrganizeExperience.sql) script using the run sql feature of the Db2 Service Edition to create the tables. It will create 3 schemas - CUSTOMER, INSURANCE and MORTGAGE and 10 tables.

### Load the Data

Load the 10 tables using the load feature of the Db2 Server Edition. You can do it in any order you choose using the provided CSV files. Choose the option to *Overwrite table with new data*.

1. Select the Auto Insurance Claim.csv file and load it into the INSURANCE.AUTO_INSURANCE table.
1. Select the Auto Insurance Policy.csv file and load it into the INSURANCE.AUTO_POLICY table.
1. Select the Customer.csv file and load it into the CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER table.
1. Select the Customer Activity.csv file and load it into the CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ACIVITY table.
1. Select the Customer Attrition.csv file and load it into the CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ATTRITION table.a
1. Select the Customer Offers.csv file and load it into the CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_OFFERS table.
1. Select the Mortgage Applicant.csv file and load it into the MORTGAGE.MORTGAGE_APPLICANT table.
1. Select the Mortgage Customer.csv file and load it into the MORTGAGE.MORTGAGE_CUSTOMER table.
1. Select the Mortgage Default.csv file and load it into the MORGAGE.MORTGAGE_DEFAULT table.
1. Select the Mortgage Property.csv file and load it into the MORTGAGE.MORTGAGE_PROPERTY table.

> Note - You can change the script to create and load the data all at once. I just have not had time to create one.
