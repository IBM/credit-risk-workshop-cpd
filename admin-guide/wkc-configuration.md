* Under `Discovery root` drill down and check `CUSTOMER`, `INSURANCE`, and `MORTGAGE`.

  > *Note: If you experience issues using the drill down, enter the following root: `schema[BLUDB|CUSTOMER];schema[BLUDB|INSURANCE];schema[BLUDB|MORTGAGE]`*

* Click all the options and choose `1000` for max number of records to scan.

* Under `Project`: click the `Add project` option. In the `Create Project` pop up window, enter `Enterprise` as the name and click the `Create` button.

* Click the `Discover` button.
